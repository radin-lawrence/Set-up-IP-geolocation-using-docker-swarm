# Set-up-IP-geolocation-using-docker-swarm

Geolocation refers to the use of location technologies such as GPS or IP addresses to identify and track the whereabouts of connected electronic devices. Because these devices are often carried on an individual's person, geolocation is often used to track the movements and location of people and surveillance.

It is same as my previous git article regarding [multitier-ipgeolocation-caching-docker-compose](https://github.com/radin-lawrence/multitier-ipgeolocation-caching-docker-compose), But here we use docker swarm and in docker swarm we use service instead of container. Also, here we use 1 master with 2 worker instances.
